We now have digitized databases as well as sophisticated and efficient algorithms, which were the missing factors for large-scale studies of ḥadīth literature. Using comprehensive datasets and recent algorithmic advances in text processing and machine learning models, we will map the use, reuse, and adaptations of ḥadīth narratives to better apprehend regional and general patterns within the whole ḥadīth literature.",
