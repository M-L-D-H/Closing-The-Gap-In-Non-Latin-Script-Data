# CtG Workflows

Closing the Gap publishes all its data and frontend code under an open-access
(OA) license. The project's GitHub repository can be freely cloned and further
developed by anyone on any local machine. This document provides comprehensive
documentation of all workflows, serving as a guide for individuals who wish to
contribute to the project or utilize the dataset for further research.

## Cloning the repository

To access our dataset, clone the `master` branch of our repository to your local
machine by following these steps:

1. Select the **master** branch from the branch dropdown menu located in the
   upper left corner of the repository webpage.

2. Open the **Code** dropdown menu and copy the **HTTPS** link.

3. In a Git Bash terminal, use the following command to clone the repository to
   your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/M-L-D-H/Closing-The-Gap-In-Non-Latin-Script-Data.git
   ```

   This command creates a local copy of the repository, allowing you to work
   with the data.

To clone the frontend code, switch to the `frontend` branch and repeat the steps
above.

If you wish to contribute to the project directly, you can create a **pull
request**, which will be reviewed and merged by our team.

## Adding New Projects

One possible contribution to our project is the addition of new research
initiatives related to **Non-Latin Script Digital Humanities (NLS DH)**. You can
contribute in one of two ways:

1. **Directly on GitHub**
   - Clone the `master` branch of the repository as described in the previous
     section.
   - Navigate to the **`TEMPLATES`** folder in the root directory.
   - Copy the **`project.json`** file and populate it with your project data.
   - Generate a **[unique UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)** and use it as
     the filename.
   - Navigate to the **`PROJECTS`** folder in the root directory and create a
     new folder named after a shortened version of your project’s title. Use all
     **lowercase letters** and replace spaces with **underscores (`_`)**.
   - Copy your completed JSON file into this folder.
   - Commit and push your changes, which will automatically open a **pull
     request**. Once reviewed, your project will be integrated into our dataset
     and website by the project team.

2. **Via Email**
   - Visit our
     **[project website](https://m-l-d-h.github.io/Closing-The-Gap-In-Non-Latin-Script-Data/)**.
   - Select the **"Contribute"** tab from the main menu.
   - Fill out the submission form
   - It will be forwarded to our team and added to the database

The second method is more straightforward; however, the online form only
captures **basic project details**. If you wish to provide more comprehensive
information, we recommend using the **GitHub submission method**.

## Adding New Keywords

Our project employs a **custom taxonomy** of keywords to classify research
projects based on their **academic discipline, research topics, outputs,
methods, and resources used**. The system strictly enforces this taxonomy,
rejecting any keywords that are not predefined. Since our taxonomy is
continuously evolving, we periodically update it with new terms.

To add new keywords, follow these steps:

1. **Open the `KEYWORDS` Folder**
   - Navigate to the **`KEYWORDS`** folder in the root directory of the
     repository.

2. **Update the `KEYWORDS.json` File**
   - Insert the new keyword **alphabetically** into the appropriate category
     within the **`KEYWORDS.json`** file, which contains the complete taxonomy.

3. **Update the `KEYWORDS_DOCUMENTATION.md` File**
   - If the keyword originates from an **existing taxonomy**, such as the
     **[DHA Taxonomy](https://vocabs.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/en/)** or
     **[TaDiRAH](https://de.dariah.eu/tadirah)**, link it to the relevant
     external resource.
   - If the keyword is **new**, provide a **brief description** explaining its
     meaning and relevance.

By maintaining a structured and curated taxonomy, we ensure **semantic
consistency** across projects and facilitate efficient data retrieval and
analysis.

## Bumping the Schema

To ensure the **consistency and integrity** of our data, we implement **schema
validation** using **Deno**. Whenever the schema is modified or updated, follow
these steps:

1. **Open the `SCHEMATA` Folder**
   - Navigate to the **`SCHEMATA`** folder in the root directory.

2. **Update the `changelog.md` File**
   - Document the changes introduced in the new schema version by updating the
     **`changelog.md`** file.

3. **Modify `project_schema.ts`**
   - This file contains the **machine-readable** description of the schema used
     for validation.
   - Update the **`schemaVersion`** variable to reflect the new version number.
   - Navigate to the specific section that requires modification (the **element
     order** follows that of all data entries).
   - Insert your changes, ensuring they adhere to the existing **TypeScript
     syntax**.
   - If you are unfamiliar with **TypeScript**, follow the structure of similar
     elements.

4. **Update the `project.json` Template**
   - In the **`TEMPLATES`** folder, apply the schema updates to
     **`project.json`**.
   - Ensure that the **`schema_version`** field is set to the new version
     number.

5. **Apply Changes to All Projects**
   - Use an **automated script** to propagate the changes across all existing
     projects.
   - Update the **schema version** within each project entry to maintain
     consistency.

By following these steps, we guarantee that all projects comply with the latest
schema version, preventing **validation errors** and ensuring **data
standardization**.

## Running Schema Tests Locally

To ensure that all our data entries adhere to the **schema**, we have
implemented a **GitHub Action** that automatically triggers schema validation
for every **pull request**.

For contributors who commit regularly, we have also enabled the ability to run
these tests **locally**, eliminating the need to push changes before validating
them.

Steps to Run the Tests Locally

1. **Ensure Deno is Installed**
   - Make sure you have
     **[Deno installed globally](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)**
     on your machine.
   - Verify the installation by running:

     ```sh
     deno --version
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository Root**

3. **Run the Test Command**  
   You can use either of the following commands to execute the schema tests:

   ```sh
   npm run test
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   deno test --allow-read TESTS/schema_tests.ts
   ```

   Both commands execute the same validation process.

4. **Review the Output**
   - The test will check all relevant files against the schema.
   - Any files that fail the validation will be listed in the terminal output.

## Fixing Broken Links with Lychee

For comprehensive documentation on our link-checking workflow using
[Lychee](https://lychee.cli.rs/), refer to the detailed
[blog post](https://ctg.hypotheses.org/203) authored by Theodore Beers.

In our repository, the Lychee configuration file is named `lychee.toml`. This
file includes:

- **Excluded Links**: A list of URLs intentionally omitted from checks,
  typically those not rendering due to reasons other than being broken or
  unavailable.
- **Additional Paths**: Specifies paths to JSON files beyond the standard
  project entries.

To utilize Lychee for checking broken links in our data:

1. **Install Lychee**: If you haven't already, install Lychee globally by
   following the instructions on the
   [Lychee installation page](https://lychee.cli.rs/usage/cli/).

2. **Run the Link Check**:
   - Open your terminal.
   - Navigate to the root directory of the repository:
   - Execute one of the following commands:

     ```sh
     npm run check-links
     ```

3. **Review the Results**:
   - Lychee will display the scan results directly in your terminal.
   - Links that fail to render will be highlighted as errors and should be
     addressed manually.

## Monthly releases to Zenodo

To ensure long-term **sustainability**, **findability**, and proper
**archiving** of our data, we publish a new version of the dataset to
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) on the **first day of each month**. This
guarantees that all changes, including new projects, updated metadata, and
schema improvements, are publicly preserved with a DOI.

We use a **GitHub Action** to automatically create a new
[GitHub release](https://github.com/M-L-D-H/Closing-The-Gap-In-Non-Latin-Script-Data/releases),
generate markdown-formatted release notes, and trigger Zenodo’s integration.
This process minimizes manual work while ensuring consistent versioning and
documentation.

## Sending the frontend copy to Wayback Machine

To support **sustainability**, **traceability**, and **public access**, we
archive the frontend of the _Closing the Gap_ website monthly using the
[Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/). This is done automatically via a
**GitHub Action** on the 1st of each month.

Archived versions can be viewed at [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org) by
entering the site URL and selecting a snapshot.

## Updating Dependencies

The functionality of our project relies on several external dependencies. To
ensure long-term stability and sustainability, we deliberately use only
well-established and actively maintained packages. Among these are: `prettier`,
`zod`, and `lychee`. These dependencies are not automatically updated and must
be managed manually.

To update the dependencies:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command to update all dependencies listed in
   `package.json`:

   ```sh
   npm update
   ```

   This will update your local `node_modules` and overwrite the
   `package-lock.json` file, which is responsible for ensuring consistent
   installations across different environments.

> 🛈 Note: Some tools used in the project, like `deno` and `lychee`, are not
> managed via npm and must be updated separately using their respective package
> managers or installers.

## Adding Contributors

Our project acknowledges all internal and external contributors. Every team
member is listed in the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file. We utilize the
[CRediT Taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org/) to appropriately categorize each
member's contributions. This file should be updated each time a new researcher
joins the team.

External contributions primarily involve providing project data to our dataset.
In such cases, the contribution is recorded in the `record_created_by` element
of our data entry, with the contributor's name as the value.

## Rebuilding the Site Manually

Our website is hosted on **GitHub Pages**. Given our strong emphasis on
**sustainability**, we have designed it to be fully **static**. All data is
consolidated into a JSON file (**`ENTRIES.json`**), which serves as the
foundation for rendering the site. This file requires **manual updates**, which
we perform **once a week**.

> **Automated Check**  
> A GitHub Action runs every **Monday and Thursday** to verify whether the
> frontend is up to date.  
> While this workflow checks for outdated data, it **does not update** the site
> automatically. Manual deployment is still required.

To manually deploy the website, follow these steps:

**1. Ensure `npm` is Installed**  
Before proceeding, verify that **Node.js** and its package manager (`npm`) are
installed on your local machine.

**2. Switch to the `frontend` Branch**  
Navigate to the **frontend branch** of the repository using Git:

```sh
git checkout frontend
```

**2. Build and Deploy the Website**  
To regenerate static data, rebuild and deploy the website, execute the following
commands:

```sh
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

- Running **`npm run build`** is **optional** but recommended, as it verifies
  whether the website can be built correctly.
- If there are any issues, the command will return an **error** without
  publishing the changes.
- If successful, **`npm run deploy`** will regenerate static data publish the
  updated website.

By following these steps, you ensure that the site remains **up-to-date** while
maintaining its **static structure** for sustainability and efficiency.
